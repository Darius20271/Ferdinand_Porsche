        <p>
            Founded in 1931, Dr. Ing. h.c. F. Porsche GmbH began as an engineering consultancy. Ferdinand Porsche's vision was to design efficient, high-performance vehicles.  
            The first major success was the Volkswagen Beetle in 1938. After WWII, Ferry Porsche introduced the Porsche 356 in 1948, a lightweight sports car with aerodynamic design and excellent handling.  
            Today, Porsche is a global luxury and performance brand, with Ferdinand's innovations as its foundation.
