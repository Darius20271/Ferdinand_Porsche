            Ferdinand Porsche was born on September 3, 1875, in Maffersdorf, Bohemia (modern-day Czech Republic). 
            Fascinated by technology from a young age, he installed electric lighting in his family home at just 15. 
            Despite limited formal education, he attended the Imperial Technical School in Reichenberg, where he honed his skills in mechanics and electricity.
